A rough install and troubleshooting outline for getting Oocyte Valve Controller software to work on a new install 
2/16/26
I use Spyder as the IDE.  I usually need to change the preferences: interpreter to the path Python is installed to.  I also usually install it without the whole suite of whatever ("anaconda"), so it often doesn't have pip, and a number of other things aren't set correctly out of the gate, so to speak.  Here's the solution / task list:
1a. Make an appointment with IT to do admin install (because we're attached to a hospital so everything is locked down and no admin for anyone but the special): Python for all users and the D2XX drivers (most of the rest can use the user-level install - no admin needed)
1b. install everything
2. find the actual location of the Python install;  in cmd type: where python ;  use this location in Spyder's preferences: interpreter (path & .exe all needed)
3. in the command line and in the correct python path, type: python.exe -m pip install amftools
4. since we're using the non spyder version of python interpreter, we need the terminal window for Spyder, too: [in the python folder] python -m pip install spyder-kernels==3.1.*
5. I assume you've added the repository and program. If not, I use Sourcetree - fairly GUI / user friendly.  don't forget to add the path to our program is in (wherever you cloned it)
6. if it can't find the D2xx drivers make the code is running the lines: DLL_PATH = r'C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\ftdibus.inf_amd64_6d7e924c4fdd3111\amd64'
os.add_dll_directory(DLL_PATH)  . . . . (or whatever the path is) I tried adding it to the path but it still missed it.
7. enjoy!  this got it working for me on a new install.  Main program is still under development. Please add notes.
